# Learning Python with Just Github Copilot

During our **[first-time experience video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfnbzVae-Zw) with Github Copilot**, we mentioned that one of the uses could be learning a new language.  This repo is an ongoing result of a video series experiment: _"Learning Pythong with Github Copilot"._

**Some things to keep in mind about the series:**

1. It's not meant to teach you Python.  This is an experiment to see how far one can go just using Github Copilot
2. It's raw, unplanned, and almost entirely unedited. So keep that in mind.
